# Antares Assets

This is a place where [Antares](https://www.antarescircuit.io) users can share circuits, 
projects and libraries with other users.

## Contents
### Circuits

Share single, reusable [circuits](circuits/circuits.md) other users can import into their own projects or libraries.

### Projects

Share entire [project](projects/projects.md) other users can learn from.

### Libraries

Share entire [libraries](libraries/libraries.md) of cohesive circuits, such as the 7400 series.

## How to use assets

Download the ZIP file from the asset description page and import it into your running Antares program.

* **Circuits**: In the workbench, go to your target project or library folder an use the context 
  menu "Import Circuit".
* **Projects**: Open the "Projects" dialog and choose "Import" to import the project.
* **Libraries**: Importing libraries will be implemented with issue #215 in one of the next Antares 
  releases.

## How to contribute

Fork this GitHub project, add an asset you have previously exported from Antares, and create a pull request. Users with write permission will quickly review your new assets and commit your change to the main branch.

Create a new issue if you find bugs in published assets.

Also feel free to start discussions in the project's discussion board.

## Design Guidelines

* Circuits are built from a minimal set of build-in components, ideally from Antares' "Standard 
  Library".
* Screenshots should use a bright theme with white background, ideally using Antares' "Black and 
  White" theme.
